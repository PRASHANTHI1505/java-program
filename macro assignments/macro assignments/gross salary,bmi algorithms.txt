inches, and then calculates their body mass index (BMI). The program should then output whether 
they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their BMI.

   
BMI = weight in kilograms / (height in meters)^2

step1:start
step2:declare BMI,height,weight
step3:assign the values to height,weight
step4:perform BMI=weigth/height^2
step5:if BMI <=18.5
step6:print underweight otherwise goto step7
step7:if BMI<=20
step8:print normal otherwise goto step9
step9:if BMI<=30
step10:print overweight otherwise goto step11
step11:if BMI>30
step12:prit obese
step13:stop


WAP to input basic salary of an employee and calculate its Gross salary according to following:
    Basic Salary <= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80%
    Basic Salary <= 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90%
    Basic Salary > 20000 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%


step1:start
step2:declare the employee salary,DA,HRA
step3:if salary <=10000
step4:print da=(10000*80)/100 and hra =(10000*20)/100 and calculate gross salary=(HRA + DA + Basic salary)
step5:otherwise go to step6
step6:if salary <=20000
step7:print da=(20000*90)/100 and hra=(20000*25)/100 and calculate gross salary=(HRA + DA + Basic salary)
step8:other wise go to step9
step9:if salary >20000
step10:print da=(20000 *95)/100 and hra=(20000*30)/100 and calculate gross salary=(HRA + DA + Basic salary)
step11:print gross salary
step12:other wise not print salary
