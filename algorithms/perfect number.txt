perfect number
step1:start
step2:declare the variable num,sum,count
step3:read the variable num,sum=0,count=1
step4: check wheather count is less than or equal to num if it is true then go to step5
otherwise go to step9
step5:check wheather  the num is divisible by count or not (num%count<=0)
if it is true then go to step6
step6:add sum,count value and store the result in sum(sum=sum+count)
step7:increment count value  by one until the count les than or equal to num
step8:repeat step4 until the count less than or equal to num
step9:check wheather the sum is equal to num or not (sum== num)
if it is true then go to step10 otherwise go to step11
step10:print num is perfect number
step11:print num is not a perfect number
step12:stop
